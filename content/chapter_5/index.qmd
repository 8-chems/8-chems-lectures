## Summary of that chapter {}

Experimental design is a fundamental approach in research and data analysis that enables the investigation of causal relationships between variables. This chapter introduces the key concepts and types of experimental design, including the roles of **independent and dependent variables**, **randomization**, and **replication**. 

Learners will explore the distinction between **controlled and experimental groups**, the principles of **A/B testing**, its step-by-step implementation, and practical applications. Additionally, the chapter covers important concepts of **causality versus correlation** and introduces common **statistical tests** used to validate experimental findings.
