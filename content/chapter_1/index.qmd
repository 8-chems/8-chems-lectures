## Summary of that chapter {}

Data Science combines a collection of methods, tools, and techniques aimed at extracting useful knowledge or reusable patterns from raw data. This process involves several key stages â€” acquiring, preparing, modeling, and visualizing data, followed by deploying appropriate analytical tools.

In a world where most decisions are made based on partial information and uncertain outcomes, data science helps reduce uncertainty by applying robust computational methods. It provides a systematic framework to derive precise, reliable, and quantitative insights from any set of observations.
