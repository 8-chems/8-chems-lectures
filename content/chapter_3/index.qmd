## Summary of that chapter {}

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in the data science workflow, aimed at understanding the underlying structure, patterns, and relationships within a dataset. This chapter introduces key techniques for analyzing and preparing data, including handling outliers, examining pairwise and categorical variables, applying data transformations, and performing data smoothing.

Additionally, learners will explore both **basic and advanced data preprocessing**, with an emphasis on **feature engineering** to enhance the quality and predictive power of data for modeling.
