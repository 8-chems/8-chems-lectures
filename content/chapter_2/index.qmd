## Summary of that chapter {}

Data integration is a critical aspect of modern data management, involving the process of combining data from multiple sources to provide a unified view. This chapter covers the foundational concepts and techniques necessary for effective data integration.

We begin with an overview of **data structures and types**, **data collection methods**, and **data storage systems**, followed by an introduction to **Big Data** concepts. Key techniques of data integration are then explored, including **duplicate detection and resolution**, **schema matching**, **semantic integration**, and **value alignment**, illustrated with a practical **ETL example**.

Finally, we discuss common **challenges in data integration** and address important considerations regarding **ethics and privacy**, ensuring that data integration is both efficient and responsible.
