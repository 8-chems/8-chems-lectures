## Going further {.unnumbered}

This course does not really address issues of volume or speed of 
computation. 
`Pandas` can show its limits in this area with large datasets
(several gigabytes).

It is therefore interesting to consider:

* The book [Modern Pandas](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1-intro.html)
for additional insights on performance with `Pandas`;
* The question of
[sparse objects](https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/vectors_matrices_and_arrays/create_a_sparse_matrix/);
* The _packages_ [`Dask`](https://dask.org/) or [`Polars`](https://ssphub.netlify.app/post/polars/) to speed up computations;
* [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/overview.html) for very efficient SQL queries;
* [`PySpark`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) for very large datasets.
